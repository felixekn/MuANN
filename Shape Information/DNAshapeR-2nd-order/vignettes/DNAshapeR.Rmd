## Introduction

DNAshapeR predicts DNA shape features in an ultra-fast, high-throughput 
manner from genomic sequencing data. The package takes either nucleotide 
sequence or genomic intervals as input, and generates various graphical 
representations for further analysis. DNAshapeR further encodes DNA 
sequence and shape features for statistical learning applications by 
concatenating feature matrices with user-defined combinations of k-mer 
and DNA shape features that can be readily used as input for machine 
learning algorithms.

In this vignette, you will learn: 

* how to load/install DNAshapeR

* how to predict DNA shape features

* how to visualize DNA shape predictions

* how to encode sequence and shape features, and apply them


## Load DNAshapeR

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(DNAshapeR)
```

## Predict DNA shape features
The core of DNAshapeR, the DNAshape method (Zhou, et al., 2013), uses a 
sliding pentamer window where structural features unique to each of the 
512 distinct pentamers define a vector of minor groove width (MGW), Roll, 
propeller twist (ProT), and helix twist (HelT) at each nucleotide position. 
MGW and ProT define base-pair parameters whereas Roll and HelT represent 
base pair-step parameters.

DNAshapeR can predict DNA shape features from custom FASTA files or directly 
from genomic coordinates in the form of a GRanges object within Bioconductor 
(see <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html> 
for more information). 

### From FASTA file

To predict DNA shape features from a FASTA file

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(DNAshapeR)
fn <- system.file("extdata", "CGRsample.fa", package = "DNAshapeR")
pred <- getShape(fn)
```

### From genomic intervals (e.g. TFs binding sites, CpG islands, replication origins, ...)

To predict DNA shape from genomic intervals stored as GRanges object, a 
reference genome is required. Several reference genomes are available 
within BioConductor as BSgenome objects 
(see <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BSgenome.html> 
for more information). For example, the sacCer3 release of the *S.Cerevisiae* 
genome can be retrieved by

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install Bioconductor packages
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("BSgenome.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3")

library(BSgenome.Scerevisiae.UCSC.sacCer3)
```

Given a reference genome, the **getFasta** function first extracts the DNA 
sequences based on the provided genomic coordinates, and then performs shape 
predictions within a user-defined window (of size equal to width, 100 bp in 
the example below) computed from the center of each genomic interval:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create a query GRanges object
gr <- GRanges(seqnames = c("chrI"),
            strand = c("+", "-", "+"),
            ranges = IRanges(start = c(100, 200, 300), width = 100))
getFasta(gr, Scerevisiae, width = 100, filename = "tmp.fa")
fn <- "tmp.fa"
pred <- getShape(fn)
```

### From public domain projects

The genomic intervals can also be obtained from public domain projects, 
including ENCODE, NCBI, Ensembl, etc. The AnnotationHub package 
(see <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationHub.html> 
for more information) provides an interface to retrieve genomic intervals 
from these multiple online project resources.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install Bioconductor packages
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
library(AnnotationHub)
```

The genomic intervals of interest can be selected progressively through the 
functions of **sebset** and **query** with keywords, and can be subjected as 
an input of GRanges object to **getFasta** function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ah <- AnnotationHub()
ah <- subset(ah, species=="Homo sapiens")
ah <- query(ah, c("H3K4me3", "Gm12878", "Roadmap"))
getFasta(ah[[1]], Hsapiens, width = 150, filename = "tmp.fa")
fn <- "tmp.fa"
pred <- getShape(fn)
```

## Visualize DNA shape prediction
DNAshapeR can be used to generate various graphical representations for 
further analyses. The prediction result can be visualized in the form of 
scatter plots (Comoglio, et al., 2015), heat maps (Yang, et al., 2014), 
or genome browser tracks (Chiu, et al., 2014).

### Ensemble representation: metashape plot
The prediction result can be visualized in the metaprofiles of DNA shape 
features.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
plotShape(pred$MGW)
#plotShape(pred$ProT)
#plotShape(pred$Roll)
#plotShape(pred$HelT)
```

### Ensemble representation: heat map
The prediction result can be visualized in the heatmap of DNA shape features.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
library(fields)
heatShape(pred$ProT, 20)
#heatShape(pred$MGW, 20)
#heatShape(pred$Roll[1:500, 1:1980], 20)
#heatShape(pred$HelT[1:500, 1:1980], 20)
```


### Individual representation: genome browser-like tracks
The prediction result can be visualized in the form of genome browser tracks.

*Note that the input data should only contain one sequence.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.align='center', eval=TRUE}
fn2 <- system.file("extdata", "SingleSeqsample.fa", package = "DNAshapeR")
pred2 <- getShape(fn2)
trackShape(fn2, pred2) # Only for single sequence file
```

## Encode sequence and shape features
DNAshapeR can be used to generate feature vectors for a user-defined model. 
These models can consist of either sequence features (1-mer, 2-mer, 3-mer), 
shape features (MGW, Roll, ProT, HelT), or any combination of those two. 
For 1-mer features, sequence is encoded in form of four binary numbers 
(i.e., in terms of 1-mers, 0001 for adenine, 0010 for cytosine, 0100 for 
guanine, and 1000 for thymine) at each nucleotide position (Zhou, et al., 
2015). The encoding function of the DNAshapeR package enables the 
determination of higher order sequence features, for example, 2-mers and 
3-mers (16 and 64 binary features at each position, respectively). The 
user can also choose to include second order shape features in the 
generated feature vector. The second order shape features are product 
terms of values for the same category of shape features (MGW, Roll, ProT or 
HelT) at adjacent positions. The feature encoding function of DNAshapeR 
enables the generation of any subset of these features, either only a 
selected shape category or first order shape features, and any combination 
with shape or sequence features. The result of feature encoding for each 
sequence is a chimera feature vector.

### Encoding process
A feature type vector should be defined before encoding. The vector can be
any combination of characters of “k-mer”, “n-shape”, “n-MGW”, “n-ProT”, 
“n-Roll”, “n-HelT” (k, n are integers) where “1-shape” refers to first 
order and “2-shape” to second order shape features.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(Biostrings)
featureType <- c("1-shape", "1-shape")
featureVector <- encodeSeqShape(fn, pred, featureType)
featureVector
```

### Showcase of statistical machine learning application
Feature encoding of multiple sequences thus results in a feature matrix, 
which can be used as input for variety of statistical machine learning 
methods. For example, an application is the quantitative modeling of 
SELEX-seq derived protein-DNA binding by linear regression as demonstrated 
below.

First, pre-computed binding affinity values are combined with experimental 
information in a data frame structure.

```{r eval=FALSE}
filename3 <- system.file("extdata", "SELEXsample.s", package = "DNAshapeR")
experimentalData <- read.table(filename3)
df <- data.frame(affinity=experimentalData$V1, featureVector)
```

Then, a machine learning package (which can be any learning tools) is used 
to train a multiple linear regression (MLR) model based on 10-fold 
cross-validation. In this example, we used the caret package 
(see <http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/> for more information).

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(caret)

trainControl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10, 
                savePredictions = TRUE)
model <- train (affinity~ ., data = df, 
                trControl=trainControl, method="lm", preProcess=NULL)
summary(model)
```
